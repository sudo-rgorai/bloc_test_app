# bloc_test_app

This is a test app to learn and implement BLoC pattern in flutter.

## Working

This app fetches a list of all dog breeds from [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all) and displays it in the UI using BloC pattern architecture. The state of the page is either Success, Loading or Error and accordingly the UI changes to display appropriate content.
